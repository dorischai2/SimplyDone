Currently working on a console to-do list application that will help user manage different to-do lists. The planned features includes: 

* View the list of current to-do lists
* View a particular to-do list
* Add a new list
* Modify a selected list
  * Change the status or the description of an item
  * Add items to the list
  * Remove a list from the list
* Delete a list

## Learnings so far
I have learned to efficiently to use 'vector' for dynamic arrays and it has made certain aspects of the project much easier. I also learned about 'filesystem' library to help me navigate the directories.
